I am a lecturer and Ph.D candidate in Human Resource Management at the [Ghana Institute of Management and Public Administration (GIMPA)](https://gimpa.edu.gh/). My research interests include career development, leadership training, succession planning, and entrepreneurship, with a focus on empowering individuals and organizations to take the reins. As of Fall 2024, I am a [CEGA](https://cega.berkeley.edu/) and [DIWA](https://diwa.gimpa.edu.gh/) fellow at University of California, Berkeley. 

I earned a Bachelor of Arts in Social Sciences (Economics and Geography) from the Univeristy of Cape Coast in Ghana. I also hold an MSc in Human Resource Management from the University of Sheffield in the United Kingdom.
